# conky
My conky config, fairly vanilla but adds some "nice-to-haves"
Weather, temps, time, and transparency.


## Installation
Place `conky.conf` in `.config/conky/`

I recommend renaming `conky.conf` to something else if you intend to run multiple instances.

Delete the `.git` folder if you intended to modify mine unless you want your changes wiped!

## Running my config
With conky installed, run this command:
`conky -c .config/conky/conky.conf`

I generally run this in a `tmux` session and then detach.
